This is a compliation of harmful terms found in tech and inclusive alternatives collected over the years and mentioned in the talks below.

This is a living resource for the developer experience community for updating our language to create more inclsuive products, services, and teams.



# Goals
To create a glossary of progressive industry standard terms and phrases.
To create an accessible, shareable resource for engineers, user experience practitioners, and design professionals alike.

# General Strategies
- Keep in mind everything is on the list (yet) and this is a reference guide.
- Swap 'color', 'hacker', and other implicit words with more explicit words such as good, bad, deceiving, disrespectful, actor, etc.
- Start using new terminology now. These are intened to be easy exchanges and you will still be understood or can share the meaning of a term if asked.
